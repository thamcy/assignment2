	<h2> <u> Grades </u> </h2>
<p>

		<i>Grades</i> is a distinction used by the manufacturer, Bandai, to describe generally how detailed a model is.
		Many models are available in multiple grades, depeicting the same fictional machine with different levels of detail. 
		<br><br>
		Models within a grade are generally the same scale, as seen in the tabs below. 
		However, the scale is not consistent 100% of the time although it is generally a good gauge.
</p>

<div id="First Grade" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>First Grade (1:100)</h3>
	<p>	The original 1980 line of Gundam models does not have an associated grade, since this terminology was not introduced until 1990. 
		These kits are limited in articulation, some require glue to assemble, and they must be painted for a correct appearance.
		<br><br>
		After the adoption of the grade nomenclature, Bandai began to re-release these designs with minimal updates as First Grade (FG) starting in 1999.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="High Grade" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>High Grade (1:144)</h3>
	<p>	High Grade (HG) models were introduced in 1990. The original kits featured full snap-fit assembly, an articulated internal frame 
		(for the first two kits, which provides better range of motion and is more poseable), and utilized the molding technique known as System Injection, 
		wherein multiple colors would be cast on the same part.
	</p> 
</div>

<div id="Master Grade" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Master Grade (1:100)</h3>
	<p>	MG models were first introduced in the summer of 1995, designed and made to higher standards than most other models. 
		These kits take much longer to construct and are often much more expensive than their lower-grade counterparts.
		More recent Master Grade plastic models typically feature a movable inner frame system which enables extensive movement and bending of joints, 
		as well as including standing and seating miniature figures of the pilots of each gundam model.
		<br><br>
		The popularity of this line was so great that a lot of old and new mobile suits from non-graded series were remade as Master Grade models. 
		In 2020, a special Luna Sea version Zaku II model was released with the band's single "The Beyond". 
		It commemorates the 30th anniversary of the band and the 40th anniversary of Gundam, 
		and was the first in the Master Grade series to use recycled eco-friendly plastic.
	</p>
</div>

<div id="Real Grade" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Real Grade (1:144)</h3>
	<p>	In 2010, Real Grade (RG) surpassed High Grade as the top-end series of the 1:144 Gunpla line.
	<br><br>
		Real Grade kits are differentiated from HG kits by a number of features previously found only in larger scale kits. 
		These include near perfect color accuracy without the use of color-correcting stickers, a full inner frame, high part counts, 
		advanced articulation, and extensive decals. These kits have also been redesigned to appear more "realistic" by adding additional surface detail, 
		color separation and mechanical detail.
	</p> 
</div>

<div id="Perfect Grade" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Perfect Grade (1:60)</h3>
	<p>	Perfect Grade (PG) is the highest grade line of Bandai kits. The first PG Gunpla kit was a RX 78-2 Gundam model released in 1998. 
		Only 18 kits have been released as 1/60 Perfect Grade since then.
	<br><br>
		As the name suggests, Perfect Grade gunpla kits attempt to represent the Gundam as perfectly as possible within real world limitations. 
		These limitations result in the Perfect Grade line sometimes taking several years between releases to wait for advances in model making technology.
	<br><br>
		Features like metal joints, increased detail in plastic molding and plastic quality, as well as LED lighting kits are signatures of the PG line.
	</p>

	<h2> <u> Assembly </u> </h2>
	<p>
		Gunpla assembly is an intricate task that requires alot of patience and practice. It might seem too daunting of a task at first,
		and it might seem incredibly complicated, but fret not. Every Gunpla kit comes with a set of detailed instructions and diagrams,
		allowing everyone to immerse themselves in the joys of building Gunpla from scratch.
		<br><br>
		While a regular pair of scissors or pliers will do the trick, having specialized 
		<a href="tools.html">tools</a> 
		will be of great assistance to the endeavour.

	<h2> <u> Display </u> </h2>
	
		<p>
		There are many different ways to display Gunpla and there are many examples found on the boxes they are sold in. 
		They can be placed on the table to be displayed like regular figurines. However, to replicate the full glory of 
		the fictional flying machines that they are modelled after, Gunpla fans use a special "Action base" to display their Gunpla.
		<br><br>
		These bases come in many different colors and forms, and sometimes are even provided with the model itself. 
		Some pictures below show a few differnt bases and how they can be used.
